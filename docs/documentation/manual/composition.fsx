open Thoth.Json

(**

By default, Thoth.Json provides support for most of the primitives types like `int`, `bool`, `System.Guid`, etc.

In order to build more complex types, it offers several ways to compose decoders.

## Object builder style

When working with objects, it is recommanded to use the object builder helper.

It has the benefit of putting the fields decoder and association at the same level. Indeed, when using
[map functions](#map-functions) it is easy to mess up the arguments order.

It also supports an record with any number of properties.

When using the object builder API, you first choose if the
property is required or optional.

Then you describe, for each property, how to decode it.

*)

type Point =
    {
        X: int
        Y: int
    }

Decode.object (fun get ->
    {
        X = get.Required.Raw(Decode.field "x" Decode.int)
        Y = get.Required.Raw(Decode.field "y" Decode.int)
    }
)

(**

Object builder also provides more friendly syntax
for the most common cases.

The decoder from above can be written as:

*)

Decode.object (fun get ->
    {
        X = get.Required.Field "x" Decode.int
        Y = get.Required.Field "y" Decode.int
    }
)

## Combine decoders

If your data is composed of several objects, you can construct the decoders top down.
First, you create the decoders of the different records, then you combine them together.

If we have the following JSON:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "author": {
            "name": "Triss Merigold",
            "age": 42
        },
        "post": {
            "title": "Handle JSON with fable",
            "abstract": "How to simply read data with Thoth.Json"
        }
    }
}
```
*)

(*** hide ***)

let json =
    """
{
    "data": {
        "author": {
            "name": "Triss Merigold",
            "age": 42
        },
        "post": {
            "title": "Handle JSON with Fable",
            "abstract": "How to simply read data with Thoth.Json"
        }
    }
}
    """

(**

We create types and decoders for `User` and `Post`.

*)

type User =
    {
        Name: string
        Age: int
    }

module User =

    let decoder: Decoder<User> =
        Decode.object (fun get ->
            {
                Name = get.Required.Field "name" Decode.string
                Age = get.Required.Field "age" Decode.int
            }
        )

type Post =
    {
        Title: string
        Abstract: string
    }

module Post =

    let decoder: Decoder<Post> =
        Decode.object (fun get ->
            {
                Title = get.Required.Field "title" Decode.string
                Abstract = get.Required.Field "abstract" Decode.string
            }
        )

(**

Now we combine them to form the parent record:

*)

type Data =
    {
        User: User
        Post: Post
    }

module Data =

    // Get both structures and decode them with their own decoder accordingly
    let decoder: Decoder<Data> =
        Decode.object (fun get ->
            {
                User = get.Required.Field "user" User.decode
                Abstract = get.Required.Field "port" Post.decode
            }
        )

Decode.fromString (Decode.field "data" Data.decoder) json

(**

## Map functions

The `map2`, `map3`, ..., `map8` functions take a function to build a concrete type from the result of the provided decoders.

Thoth.Json only provides `map` function up to 8 arguments, if you need more
consider using [Object builder](#object-builder) or implementing your own `mapX` function.

*)

Decode.map2
    (fun x y ->
        {
            X = x
            Y = y
        }
    )
    (Decode.field "x" Decode.int)
    (Decode.field "y" Decode.int)

(**

## Chain decoders

You can use `andThen` in order to use the result of one decoder as the input of another one.

*)

type PersonType =
    | Student
    | Teacher

module PersonType =

    let decoder: Decoder<PersonType> =
        Decode.string
        |> Decode.andThen (fun textValue ->
            match textValue with
            | "student" -> Decode.succeed Student

            | "teacher" -> Decode.succeed Teacher

            | invalid ->
                Decode.fail
                    $"""Expecting "student" or "teacher" but instead got: "%s{invalid}"""
        )

(**

The decoder will succeed only if the JSON value is a string and the string is "student" or "teacher".

## Map result to another type

When using DDD (aka Domain Driven Design) you often need to map your types.

*)

type Email = | Email of string

module Email =

    let decoder: Decoder<Email> = Decode.string |> Decode.map Email

(**

If the provided JSON is a string, the decoder will succeed and return an Email type.

:::info
For simplicity, we used `Decode.string` but in a real world scenario, you would probably want to validate the email format.
:::

## Inconsistent JSON

Sometimes it can happen that the JSON you received is not consistent or have several ways to represent a type.

In these cases, you can use `Decode.oneOf` to try different decoders.

Imagine you are parsing a list of numbers but some of them are represented as `null`.

```json
[ 1, null, 2, 3 ]
```

You can write a decoder like that:

*)

let nullableIntDecoder: Decoder<int> =
    Decode.oneOf
        [
            // First try to decode it as a standard int
            Decode.int
            // If it fails, try to decode it as a null
            Decode.nil 0
        ]

let json = "[ 1, null, 2, 3 ]"

Decode.fromString (Decode.list nullableIntDecoder) json

// Returns:
// Ok [ 1, 0, 2, 3 ]

(**

:::info
`Decode.oneOf` tests the decoders in order, so it stop after finding a successful one.
:::
